# Intro

Atmosphere is a web app that uses your local weather forecast to generate and play a unique Spotify playlist. This is accomplished by using a number of API'S, mainly:  
    - [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)  
    - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)  
    - [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/)  

## Get Started
_Under construction_  
We should fill this out with the exact build instructions for someone to get started. What does the environment need to look like in order for someone to download our code, build and run the project? That kinda stuff  

When working on a feature/issue/etc be sure to branch off of the 'dev' branch. When finished, create a pull request, when the pull request is approved then merge it back into 'dev'. Every so often, maybe like once a week or something we'll merge dev with Master. That way, there's a nice padding between our development branch and our main branch

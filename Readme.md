# Intro

Atmosphere is a web app that uses your local weather forecast to generate and play a unique Spotify playlist. This is accomplished by using a number of API'S, mainly:  
    - [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)  
    - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)  
    - [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/)  

## Get Started
